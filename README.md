# Dynamic Data Intelligence: Enabling Proactive Governance and Risk Management in AI Systems

## Description

As artificial intelligence reshapes industries, the reliability, traceability, and risk associated with data take on unprecedented importance. Dynamic Data Intelligence (DDI) is an emerging competency of data governance that empowers organizations to understand, assess, and manage the origin, quality, and cascading impacts of their data across interconnected systems.

This session explores how DDI enhances transparency and trust in AI workflows by dynamically identifying and prioritizing high-impact data through advanced modeling and analytical techniques.

## Key Takeaways

- **Pre-ingestion Data Governance:** Practical applications of DDI to ensure AI training data integrity
- **Risk Identification:** Case studies showcasing data risk management across complex workflows
